    "\n",
    "### Question 1)  What is the correlation between the Working class of individuals in this dataset, and the hours they work per week? \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Through our analysis, we can see that throughout all Working classes, average hours worked is around 40 hours/week. However, we see that both self employed options do work more than 40 hours/week more than other working classes. This can be do to many factors, they can be working more due to more motivation, they are more driven. They may be working more because they realize that if they work more, their income will be significantly higher. It was shocking to see that some individuals do work up to 99 hours per week!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2) Lets compare Gender with hours/week. We will also consider the age level for more accurate comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Through looking at selected data for comparison from our EDA, we can conclude that men in this dataset worked more than women. However, the average age for men in this dateset is higher than the average age for women. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3) What is the correlation between Salary and Age Level & Hours worked/Week?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Based on this dataset, we can say that individuals who worked more hours, with the average of 45 hours per week, earned more. Also, older individuals, with the average age of 44 earned over 50k/year. Individuals averaged age of 36 and working around 38 hours per week earned less than 50k/year.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Through this Exploratory Data Analysis that I conducted, and after exploring many factors from this dataset I can conclude that the average most individuals work is 40 hours/week, the more hours you work, the greater your salary. "
