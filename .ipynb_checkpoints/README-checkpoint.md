## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Our topic for this project is Adult incomes. With this analytics project, we hope to understand the varying patterns in adult incomes. This data is based on census data. This means that this data source is a specific population that the government systemically acquired. We are interested in this dataset because it gives us a general idea of adult incomes and their span. Also, we will be able to predict if income surpasses $50K per year. As of now, we do not have any specific questions about this dataset. We think that as we continue on with this project, some questions might arise that we would be curious to explore. Yes, we can imagine building a user-facing dashboard with this dataset. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

We will be investigating an Adult Incomes Data Set. This data was donated by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker, Data Mining and Visualization, Silicon Graphics. This data was donated on 1996-05-01. Barry Becker acquired this data from the 1994 Census database. This data is based on census data. This means that this data was collected from a specific population that the government systemically acquired. 

This data consists of: age, workclass, education, marital status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, capital gain, capital loss, hours worked per week, and native country, along with a few other attributes. 

The original purpose of this dataset was to predict whether an individuals income would surpass $50K per year. So it was like a experiment, in a sense.
